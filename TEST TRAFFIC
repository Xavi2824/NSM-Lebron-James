**ROCKNSM TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS**  

Check KIBANA FIRST within the node via systemctl status, then check the yaml config file for any mistakes. 

Zeek not populating in kibana, so we curled a webpage in sensor to see if zeek is populating.  

Ended up looking within the kafka.zeek config and found issue. Verify by curling another webpage and checking zeek logs in kibana.
